# TODO
- When there is more than one post or pre join results with an lists:and
- Generate edoc from contracts.
- Generate eunit tests from contracts.
- Generate property tests from contracts.
- Produce default values instead of an error, i.e. ?PRE(fun.., DefaultValue)
- Invariants when spawning a new process, such as its number of queued messages cannot be greater than 1, etc.
- Introduce locks

- pre in property testing to check that the inputs of a function have always some properties
- decreases  a parameter between calls when recursive
- implementation of the bridge to see how a pre can hold the starvation problems. "Starvation and Critical Race Analyzers for Ada"
- solve problems with invariants 
- Is it needed the old state in the invariant function
- liquid types
- liquid session types
- plantear poner restricciones para poder leer un mensaje o no leerlo, i.e. como una CPRE
